# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 - Matplotlib

## Project Overview

Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 


Deliverable 1
- [x] 1. The total number of rides for each city type is retrieved
- [x] 2. The total number of drivers for each city type is retrieved
- [x] 3. The sum of the fares for each city type is retrieved
- [x] 4. The average fare per ride for each city type is calculated
- [x] 5. The average fare per driver for each city type is calculated
- [x] 6. A PyBer summary DataFrame is created
- [x] 6. The PyBer summary DataFrame is formatted as shown in the example


Deliverable 2
- [x] 1. A DataFrame was created to show the total fare amount for each date and time
- [x] 2. A DataFrame was created using the pivot() function
- [x] 3. A DataFrame was created to show data from 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-29
- [x] 4. A DataFrame was created to show the sum of the fares for each week
- [x] 5. An annotated chart showing the total fares by city type


Deliverable 3
- [x] 1. Purpose of the new analysis
- [x] 2. Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types
- [x] 3. Business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types

## Summary 

PyBer is a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion and the main purpose of this document is to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize. 

The beginning of the analysis was done previously and it will be used to support this document. 

### The summary DataFrame per city type
In order to summarize the results a DataFrame was created to organize the data per city type: Urban, Suburban and Rural.
